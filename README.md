# TradingStationExample

This is an example of GUI application developed based on Scalqa. The provided example code is only for the GUI components (proprietary data mopdel is missing). 

The station is currently not used in real trading, so the code is a bit rusty by scalqa standards. GUI itself is for in-house use and not very polished. Nevertheless, this application gives a good chance to evaluate functionality, scalability, and ease of use for the API.
