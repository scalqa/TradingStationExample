# TradingStationExample

This is an example of GUI application developed based on [Scalqa](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa/). The provided code is only for the GUI components (proprietary data model is missing). 

The station is currently not used in real trading, so the code is a bit rusty. GUI itself is for in-house use and not very polished. Nevertheless, this application gives a good chance to evaluate functionality, scalability, and ease of use for the API.
